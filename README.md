# SWE261SystemA

Task: Design and Construction

Your task is to use the existing frameworks as the basis for creating a new system. Revise the sample pipe-and-filter network to read the data stream in FlightData.dat file in a Source Filter
and write the output to a text file called OutputA.csv in a Sink Filter. Format the output as follows (no need to round the values). 


Instructions:

1. unzip the folder and open a terminal with the directory containing "SWE261SystemA"
1*. I accidently named it SWE261 over 264 and I really didn't want to change the whole repository / reroute everything on git
2. Compile the necessary java files by running javac *.java into the designated terminal
3. Run the Plumber class by running "java Plumber"
4. The output is written onto a text file called "OutputA.csv.txt"

PS I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put it into a csv file because the instructions said "write the output to a text file called OutputA.csv ".
